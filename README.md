# MEAN Test App

After having tried out Javascript for one week, my MakersBnB team and I decided to challenge ourselves with learning an entirely new, fully Javascript-based tech stack for our first [Makers Academy team project](https://github.com/motri/Makersbnb). This repo contains a practise app used to try and familiarize myself with the [MEAN tech stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)), which we decided to use to create MakersBnB.

Many thanks to [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA), who created an excellent MEAN stack tutorial that helped immensely in understanding the integration of these four technologies in the short space of project time available.
